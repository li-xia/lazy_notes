Prior:

[Discussion] Why we are interested in prior? 
  a) To do better regularization. Model fitting or model selection without prior may lead to noisy and unstable estimates 
     and the result maybe totally rubish
     
  b) Better prior can help compute better posterior, thus make better predictive posterior for classification, prediction etc
  
BUT REMEMBER!!! Noninformative prior are mostly useless!
