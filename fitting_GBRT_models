Fitting Model With CV (Concept)

There are two main approaches to fit GBRT models:

1. Grid Search
Steps: 
    1. Define your parameter grid and value space (bounds and steps)
    
    2. Select a CV method (e.g., subsampling, k-folds)
    
    3. Select a metrice (e.g., loss error, mse, rmse, mape)
    
    4. Run with iterations, save current best, stop till: a) either iteration stops; b) the metrice of performance 
    no longer improved (early stop)
    
Pros: Easy

Cons: Slow, need carefully define steps, difficult to tunie multi-variate params (cor-var is not considered during tuning)


2. Optimization
Steps:
    1. Define your parameter grid and value space (bounds and steps)
    
    2. Select a CV method 
    
    3. Select a metrice
    
    4. Define an objective function (which is the average metrice of CV) for the optimizer
    
Pros: Fast! The step can be determined during optimisation, which reduce the errors on this. Also, co-var is under 
consideration. Flexible, acquisition method can be changed. Can do batched optimisation.

Cons: More codings. 


Example of fitting Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) model can be summarized:
1. We fixed max depth=5, and learning rate(eta)=0.1, run CV to find an optimal round number

2. Tune 'max depth' and 'min child weight' with others fixed
    max depth = (3, 12)
    eta = 0.1
    min child weight = (1, 6)
    gamma = 0
    sub sample = 0.8
    col sample (by tree) = 0.8
    alpha (L1 norm)=0
    
3. Tune 'gamma(0, 0.5)' with other fixed
  
4. Tune 'sub sample' (0.5, 0.9) and 'col sample' (0.5, 0.9) with other fixed
  
5. Tune 'alpha' (0, 0.05) with other fixed
  
6. Now reduce eta to 0.01 and try to find optimal rounds again
  
At the end, all tuned params (with learning rate = 0.01) can be used to fit the whole training set to build the model.
  

Remember: 
- shrinkage parameter (eta) will only affect the prediction score of the leaf nodes and not the shape of the tree
- other parameters such as gamma, max_depth, min_child_weight, max_delta_step, subsample, colsample_bytree have influence
  on the shape of the tree
